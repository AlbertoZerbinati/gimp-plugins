# gimp-plugins

This are some Gimp plugins wirtten in Python.

Realizing them was quite useful for a graphics job that I needed to automate, namely *removing the background from **all** of the images in a PowerPoint presentation*.

This project was really instructive: everything I learned is reported in the file whatilearnedsofar.txt (in Italian language).
